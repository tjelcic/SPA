Liar!
ALFRED LANNING LIT HIS CIGAR CAREFULLY, BUT the tips of his fingers were trembling slightly. His
gray eyebrows hunched low as he spoke between puffs.
“It reads minds all right-damn little doubt about that! But why?” He looked at Mathematician Peter
Bogert, “Well?”
Bogert flattened his black hair down with both hands, “That was the thirty-fourth RB model we’ve
turned out, Lanning. All the others were strictly orthodox.”
The third man at the table frowned. Milton Ashe was the youngest officer of U. S. Robot &
Mechanical Men, Inc., and proud of his post.
“Listen, Bogert. There wasn’t a hitch in the assembly from start to finish. I guarantee that.”
Bogert’s thick lips spread in a patronizing smile, “Do you? If you can answer for the entire
assembly line, I recommend your promotion. By exact count, there are seventy-five thousand, two
hundred and thirty-four operations necessary for the manufacture of a single positronic brain, each
separate operation depending for successful completion upon any number of factors, from five to a
hundred and five. If any one of them goes seriously wrong, the ‘brain’ is ruined. I quote our own
information folder, Ashe.”
